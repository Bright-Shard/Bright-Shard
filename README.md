Hi, I'm BrightShard! I'm a teenage Python developer, privacy enthusiest, and ethical-hacker-in-training. I make FOSS apps on GitHub and upload them to my website (Which is hosted here on GitHub Pages!) and, of course, put the source code in the repos here.

I am currently working on a few projects (All open source):
- **Cookie Clicker++** (Released): Cookie Clicker cheats using userscripts. Because why not.
- **Muck++** (Being programmed): Muck cheats, so I can learn the basics of Unity game hacking.
- **BrightSS** (Being developed): Roblox admin panel/serverside, so I can learn Roblox Lua.
- **BrightBot** (Development paused after Discord.py was stopped): A free Discord bot. That's right, no paying $50+/year for bot features (*cough cough*, MEE6)!
