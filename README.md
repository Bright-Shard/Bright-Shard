I'm BrightShard, a teenage Python developer and hacker.

Languages I know: Python, Roblox Lua, Arduino, HTML/CSS/JS, C# in Unity (Not good with this one)

Hacking knowledge: I know the basics of classic tools (Kali, Burpsuite, NMap, Nessus, Metasploit, etc.), but prefer HID attacks (Go look at my HiddenHID project!)

I (used to) use Arch btw ;)
