Hi, I'm BrightShard! I'm a teenage Python developer, privacy enthusiest, and ethical-hacker-in-training. I make FOSS apps on GitHub and upload them to my website (Which is hosted here on GitHub Pages!) and, of course, put the source code in the repos here.

I am currently working on two projects:
- **Hypertasker:** This is a kind of hub for managing tasks. Hypertasker will have a calendar, to-do list, email client, note taker, and, hopefully, a RSS reader to bring all of those frustrating tasks in hundreds of apps into one place.
- **Shell Striker:** This Armitage-inspired hacking GUI will have automated vulnerability scanning and exploit searching, as well as a shell manager to bring everything into one place.
