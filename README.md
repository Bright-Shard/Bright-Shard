Hi, I'm BrightShard! I'm a teenage Python developer, privacy enthusiest, and ethical-hacker-in-training. I make FOSS apps on GitHub and upload them to my website (Which is hosted here on GitHub Pages!) and, of course, put the source code in the repos here.

I am currently working on a few projects:
- **BrightBot** (Released): An open-source and free Discord bot. That's right, no paying $50+/year for bot features (*cough cough*, MEE6)!
- **Hypertasker** (Being programmed): An open-source Python app for combining all of the niche tasks from note-taking to calendaring to email-checking. Should bring down your browser tab count by ~3 million.
- **Shell Striker** (Being theorized): An open-source 1337 Capture the Flag tool, written in Python to automate recon, exploit finding, and shell management. Probably won't be useful for much more than CTFs, as it probably won't be extremely stealthy.
