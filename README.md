I'm a teenage developer and hacker. I have a ton of different projects, from [windowing](https://github.com/loki-chat/lokinit) to [OS development](https://github.com/bright-shard/bs). I'm currently working on [BS](https://github.com/bright-shard/bs), an x86-64 operating system.

I am currently trying to embed my website [as an svg](https://beta.brightshard.dev/site.svg); any random stuff below is this probably a failed attempt at that.

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://beta.brightshard.dev/site.svg" width="900" height="500" />
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="2.0">
        <use href="https://beta.brightshard.dev/site.svg#site">
    </svg>
</div>
